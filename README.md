## *For TA: Assignment Tasks*
0. Project proposal
    * Please see `docs/proposal.pdf` [here](https://github.com/charVANder/CS6620-Final-Project/blob/main/docs/proposal.pdf).
1. Present initial problem statement and its constituent tasks. The initial problem statement might resemble an epic and the tasks should take the form of user stories (like "As a _____ I need ____ so I can ____").
    * Please see `docs/statement_and_tasks.pdf` [here](https://github.com/charVANder/CS6620-Final-Project/blob/main/docs/statement_and_tasks.pdf).
2. Present cloud architecture diagram(s), include explanations about alternatives and their tradeoffs.
    * Please see `docs/architecture.pdf` [here](https://github.com/charVANder/CS6620-Final-Project/blob/main/docs/architecture.pdf).
3. You can see my notebook on how I parsed the academic license data via the DrugBank Schema in `docs/parsing_data.html` (just download the file and double click on it)
4. Create the proof of concept
    * Can be displayed through MVP using only 2 drugs. Will use the `demo/test_poc.txt` drugs found [here](https://github.com/charVANder/CS6620-Final-Project/blob/main/demo/test_poc.txt).
5. Create the MVP
    * Can be displayed by going though list of drugs. Will use the `demo/test_mvp.txt` drugs found [here](https://github.com/charVANder/CS6620-Final-Project/blob/main/demo/test_mvp.txt).
